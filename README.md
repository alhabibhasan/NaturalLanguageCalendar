# NaturalLanguageCalendar
Created a natural language calendar as part of an assignment. 
Still has *loads* of room for improvement.

For the calendar inputs should be in the following format:
<Action> at <Date time> at <Location>

For reminders, use the preffix 'remind me to' followed by the action
